          I collaboratively researched, prototyped, and designed the end-to-end
          product experience for an interactive water bottle intended to aid
          individuals experiencing a panic attack.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our team of three was tasked with creating a design response in the
          mental health space. We spent 10 weeks defining our problem space,
          ideating, and prototyping and testing Homio, a product supporting
          panic attack recovery.
        </p>
        <p>
          Homio is a customizable water bottle with tactile, interactive
          attachments to help individuals ground themselves in reality and
          regain a sense of control during a panic attack. Homio also dispenses
          aromatherapeutic scents associated with relaxation and stress relief.
          The product website allows users to try sample swatches, customize and
          build their own bottle, and order add-ons.

          <h2 style="padding: 0;">The classroom</h2>
          <p>
            Panic attacks happen without warning at anywhere,
            anytime—experiencing one in a public setting adds anxiety to this
            already mentally and physically debilitating event.
          </p>
          <p>
            We narrowed in on classrooms because among our target users, this is
            where they spend much of their day and it is often a source of
            stress.

            other long-term recovery methods. Rather, our goal is to support
            individuals in the highly focused moment of a panic attack, when
            they feel least in control.

        surrounding panic attacks and get a closer glimpse into people's

          Our sensory cube concept aimed to lean into the power of grounding

          scents, and textures embedded into each side. This was meant to be
          portable, perhaps attached to a keychain for easy access. The goal is
          to help divert people’s thoughts toward a more relaxed state, so they
          can recover from the symptoms of a panic attack discreetly.

          asked participants to tell us what they liked and disliked and if they
          felt comfortable or uncomfortable about the materials in the context
          of anxious situations.

          The size of the cube keychain was slightly too big, and participants
          felt it could be difficult to access. People felt somewhat comfortable

          smelling it or holding it up to the eye) felt awkward.

          Since the general response to the keychain was that it was awkward and
          could be perceived as childish, we had to rethink our form factor. We
          wanted to explore objects that already exist in the everyday life of a
          student. We held a mini co-design session where we asked participants
          what they carried with them on a daily basis. Looking around, we saw
          one thing that pretty much everyone had on the table was a personal
          water bottle. We decided to go forward with a water bottle concept as
          it promotes hydration, is easily accessible, and integrates seamlessly
          with the classroom setting.

          where the user can easily access them. To make the attachments as
          inconspicuous as possible, they match the color of the bottle by
          default. The cap contains a small, twist-to-open compartment where
          scent concentrates can be applied when they run out. The bottle was 3D
          modeled using Blender and comes in 5 different colors, the default
          selection being white.

          Everyone has their own unique reactions to different textures and
          scents—what's helpful and relaxing to one person may not be to
          another. To account for these differences, we designed a sample box
          for users to try out attachments before choosing their final
          customization. We developed the following scent and texture assortment
          based on our prototyping insights and secondary research. Our scents
          not only range in their benefits, but also cater to people’s
          preferences—varying from sweet to more herbal and earthy tones. The
          textures we provide also range from being passive and soothing to more
          interactive.

          This was a challenging, yet rewarding experience that taught me a lot
          about designing for a product with multimodal touchpoints and working
          closely with sensitive populations.

          The importance of co-design in sensitive design topics
        </p>
        <p>
          Mental health carries a lot of stigma, trauma, and characteristics
          that vary from person to person. We kept this in mind throughout our
          process, from problem definition to the final design response. I
          discovered that co-design is a particularly powerful method to connect
          with your audience's needs and keep them involved throughout the
          design process. In participant research, it was important to craft
          questions and activities thoughtfully to ensure they weren't
          potentially triggering or uncomfortable. In our design, we wanted to
          counter traditional cold, detached mental health tools by making ours
          feel warm, approachable, and accepting.

          This was one of the first times I designed for a physical product,
          which meant there were a lot of opportunities for personal learning
          throughout this process. Everywhere we looked, there were constraints
          with regards to material, durability, and costs. I learned that rapid
          prototyping with recycled materials is a great way to test out ideas
          quickly and inexpensively. Additionally, with three different touch
          points of our product (the physical bottle, the website, and the
          packaging), it was a challenge to make the overall user experience
          feel seamless throughout. However, thoughtful branding and a unified
          design language helped in creating a more connected experience.
