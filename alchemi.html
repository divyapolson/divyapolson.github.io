          For our graduate capstone, our team spent 6 months remotely
          researching and designing a game to encourage computational thinking
          and storytelling in children 9 to 12 years old.
        </p>
        <p>
          Alchemi is an interactive tablet game for kids to craft magical
          recipes as metaphors that promote computational thinking. Children
          play as Alchemi, a young witch who creates potions to help creatures
          with unique problems. Through a storytelling adventure, players can
          follow recipes, build custom creations, and join a community of potion
          makers.

            <p>
              Amy has a tablet that her parents bought her that she uses to
              watch videos, play games, and message friends. Despite being
              familiar with technology, she’s never thought about how the things
              she consumes are created.
            </p>
            <p>
              Kids like Amy primarily only use technology to consume content—
              they don’t often use it to make art, create music, code or write,
              etc.

              Coding courses are systemically taught in a solitary way
            </h2>
            <p>
              Amy has become interested in learning how to code. Her mother gave
              her a programming book, but she never opens it. She thought coding
              would be fun, but so far it feels overwhelming and intimidating.
            </p>
            <p>
              Today, traditional approaches used to teach computer science are
              often met with the same reaction. Due to the solitary nature of
              learning in this field, the idea of coding being an independent
              activity is perpetuated across all age levels for beginners.

              The field of computer science isn’t beginner-friendly and
              welcoming
            </h2>
            <p>
              When Amy dives into the world of coding, she finds that
              applications are hard to start, tutorials don’t match her
              expectations, and lessons don't relate to the bigger picture.
            </p>
            <p>
              In addition, the field is still majority white and Asian men.
              While Amy has years before considering careers, her perception of
              coding is defined by what she sees and hears at this age.

              Alchemi leverages a drag-and-drop visual programming interface for
              creating recipe commands. Players select and combine blocks in
              unique ways, building sets upon each other to develop a creative
              potion algorithm.
            </p>
            <p>
              Our block design has signifiers to indicate how blocks can be
              placed together and the possibilities for connection. Ridges and
              outlines have been thoughtfully crafted to mimic a puzzle-like fit
              and suggest likely block groupings.
            </p>
            <p>
              Additionally, we carefully selected accessible colors for our
              blocks as none of the leading computation education platforms
              (including Scratch) do so.

            As a remote team, synthesis involved taking advantage of
            collaborative online tools to make sense of our data. We used
            transcription tools like Otter.ai to comb through participant
            responses, identify key takeaways, and select relevant quotes. We
            used Figma to organize our digital post-its and affinity diagram.

            Testing
          </h2>
          <p>
            With the same five kids we co-designed with previously, our second
            session was a usability test of our proposed UI. This was a Wizard
            of Oz experiment in which we manually created the outputs and
            milestones that would appear in the game, testing the core
            interactions of our design. The goals going into this testing
            session were:
          </p>

          <ol>
            <li>
              Evaluate whether the metaphor of creating a potion to learn
              computational thinking is engaging to the user
            </li>
            <li>
              Understand if the core interaction of translating a presented
              recipe into code (using the drag-and-drop UI) makes sense to the
              user
            </li>

            <p>
              The kids were excited to engage in storytelling and offered rich
              characters with detailed backstories. Despite these being magical
              creatures, participants brought up issues such as loneliness,
              anxiety, and depression, and stories involving characters that
              wanted to find peace or make friends.

              Given a range of illustrative styles and settings, all of the kids
              gravitated towards the illustrations that were more realistic
              looking, had a lot of visual interest and detail within them.

            <p>
              Kids adopted to this style of game play very quickly and easily
              understood how recipe building fit into the bigger story. All but
              one of the kids completed the recipes and had no trouble making
              revisions. We used feedback to embed the characters to be more
              visually present throughout gameplay in our final design.

            <p>
              Alchemi focuses on storytelling and coding but we believe there is
              potential to integrate more interdisciplinary activities. We are
              interested in including music, dancing, drawing, and even paper
              crafts.

            <p>
              We have many ideas on how to incorporate more collaboration into
              Alchemi such as pair programming activities and group challenges
              with friends. These features simply did not fit within the time
              constraints of our initial production, but we recognize the value
              of social learning.

            <p>
              As Alchemi evolves, we want to encourage experimentation with
              delightfully unexpected outcomes. For instance, if a recipe is
              executed incorrectly, the player might end up discovering a
              completely new (but still effective) potion.

            Remote teamwork
          </h2>
          <p>
            With the exception of a couple initial problem setting meetings, the
            entire six month project was conducted remotely due to Covid-19.
            While this presented unique challenges, it was also a great learning
            experience that required a lot of creative adaptation. We conducted
            team meetings over Zoom, interviewed experts virtually, synthesized
            insights on Figma, and even used Miro, an online whiteboarding team
            tool, to conduct prototype testing with children. Over the course of
            this project, I became comfortable working as part of a remote team,
            researching and designing all from my desk at home.
          </p>
          <h2 style="padding-top: 20px;">
            Testing with children
          </h2>
          <p>
            Although I have done research and design with children before, this
            project grew my understanding of this age group. Testing with
            children remotely added an extra layer of complication, as many
            tools like Zoom are not designed with children in mind. However, we
            remained focused on our principle of child-centered design and used
            co-design to build rapport, ensure their ideas were heard, and truly
            incorporate their needs. Many of the characters in Alchemi were
            directly inspired by the stories the children shared with us, and it
            made them excited to see their creatures come to life in the final
            game.

            Motion and sound design
          </h2>
          <p>
            I had the opportunity to dive deep into the animation and sound
            design for this game. While overwhelming at times, it was a lot of
            fun studying the principles of motion design and creating
            microinteractions that added an additional layer of polish to our
            product. After this project, I gained a new level of appreciation
            for game designers and all the moving parts that are needed to
            publish a game.
