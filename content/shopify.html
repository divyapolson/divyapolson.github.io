                <br/>
                <p>Users want a streamlined shopping experience. The final solution
was a checkout app that can be used to purchase items in big chain retail stores in the US,
paired with a new IoT-connected magnetic security tag. With this, our goal is to enable
streamlined self-checkout while retaining protection against shoplifting. Following further discussion and ideation, we targeted creating an easier, faster checkout
experience for shoppers at Macy’s.</p>

                <p class="topic">user research and insights</p>
                <br/>
                <p>To further understand customer needs, we interviewed young people about their general checkout experience in retail stores. We asked questions such as the following:</p>
                <br/>
                <ul>
                    <li>How often do you shop at large retail chain stores? </li>
                    <li>Tell us about an irritating checkout experience at a retail store.</li>
                    <li>What is your ideal checkout experience?</li>
                    <li>How important (on a scale from 1-10) is speed when you check out?</li>
                    <li>Do you usually use self check-out at other stores? Why/why not?</li>
                    <li>Is there anything you would improve about self check-out?</li>
                </ul>
                <br/>
                                                <div>
                    <img class="feature" src="../assets/shopify/ideal.png" />
                </div>
                <br/>
                <p>People said that their ideal checkout experience was speedy, involved talking to staff as little as possible, and getting help from sales associates when needed. When rating the importance of speed in the checkout process the interviewees reported an average score of 9 (on a scale from 1-10). Overall, responses to self-checkout were positive.

                <p class="topic">our solution</p>
                <br/>
                <p>Shopify combines the traditional brick-and-mortar shopping experience with the customer behavior and independence of e-commerce. </p>
                <br/>
                <p>Customers are mainly young adults that are frequent app users, who don’t see personal contact in the store as a value-adding feature of the in-store experience. </p>

                <p>In our ideation process, we mapped out user interactions on a whiteboard and designed a cognitive workflow analysis. Based on this work, we came up with a low-fidelity paper prototype.</p>

                <br/>
                <p>We wanted to observe how real users would react to our app early in the development process, so we presented them with our low-fidelity paper prototype. We presented a scenario that they were in a Forever21 store, had just found a nice T-shirt, and wanted to purchase it with our app. We watched closely how they interacted with the screens and what buttons they pushed, feeding them with the corresponding new screens. We took note of where they hesitated and asked questions about how they experienced Shopify, and where they saw room for improvement. They all had very different input and steps that they liked and disliked, concerning everything from confusing symbol representation to extra selections they wanted to have, especially during account setup. From our testing, we realized that some important frames were missing (such as “Purchase Complete”) and we added tutorial frames to help user onboarding.</p>

                <p>My contributions to the project were primarily prototyping and UI/UX design. I also designed our exploratory research methods and created usability metrics for our app evaluations. For future iterations, we could add the option to save items and request help from sales associates with just a tap. Overall, I enjoyed continuous iteration and identifying usability issues through our field testing. </p>
