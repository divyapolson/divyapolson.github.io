<p style="padding-right: 40px;">Hi, I'm Divya and my passion lies in solving problems within the intersection of technology and design. I grew up in the San Francisco Bay Area surrounded by digital innovation and now, I'm in my final semester at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. In May, I will be graduating with a B.S. in Cognitive Psychology and a minor in Computer Science.<br/><br/>My research experience helps me dissect a problem and better inform user experiences based on data-driven results. In projects, I like to work with emerging technologies and be involved in both design and development. I believe that with enough Post-its, no endeavor is impossible.<br/><br/>This past summer, I was a UX Engineer intern at John Deere (Ask me about my experience!). Aside from work, I love ramen, street photography, and Spotify's Discover Weekly playlists. I'm always open to new opportunities, so feel free to get in touch!</p>
