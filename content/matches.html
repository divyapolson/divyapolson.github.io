                <br/>
                <p>Our team of 3 was given an open-ended design task: <span style="color: #1aa361; font-weight: bold;">Create a mobile app to help with play.</span> Faced with such an ambiguous challenge, we broke the prompt down further:</p>
                <br/>
                <p><ul>
                  <li>What is play?</li>
                  <li>What activities are considered play and what activities aren't?</li>
                  <li>What does it mean to help with play?</li>
                  <li>Are we making play possible or easier, and in what way?</li>
                </ul></p>

                <br/>
                <p>In order to address this prompt, we had to understand what play meant to different people. We set out into the student union, where students could be found studying, gaming, and relaxing. We approached people and asked them: <span style="color: #1aa361; font-weight: bold;">“What does play mean to you?”</span> We framed this question loosely to see what associations people came up with. Following their response, we asked them how they organized "playtime" and if they had any barriers that prevented them from playing.</p>

                <p>Unsurprisingly, we received an array of wildly different responses. Play was described as video games, basketball, and even breakdancing. Some people said they preferred doing solo activities, such as drawing, whereas others preferred group activities like multiplayer gaming and contact sports. Our interviewees reported that some of the biggest hindrances to play were <span style="color: #1aa361; font-weight: bold;">finding/making time for play and organizing group activities.</span></p>

                <p>Based on our user research, we designed multiple target statements we wanted to address with our app. We asked ourselves the following: </p>
                <br/>
                <br/>
                <div>

                <p class="topic">Our idea</p>
                <br/>
                <p>Our idea was Matches, a Tinder-inspired social platform where users can <span style="color: #1aa361; font-weight: bold;">discover activities nearby and organize events with new people who share similar interests.</span> Users can post and promote activities and swipe on events they're interested in. Activities can range from video games to sports to dancing—anything that involves socialization.
                </p>
                <br/>
                <p>Not only does Matches bring people together to play, it encourages discovering new hobbies and interests. With this mobile app, users can compete and collaborate with each other in a variety of activities, creating a local community of facilitated gameplay.</p>

                <p>We returned to the student union to conduct usability testing on our initial prototype.

                <p>From the feedback we received, we found that most people liked the concept and said they would use our app. The Tinder analogy was useful, but we realized we should not rely on it too heavily, as not everyone is familiar with the Tinder "swipe". Based on the suggestions we received, we added explicit “interested”/”not interested” buttons instead of expecting the user to only swipe left or right. We also added the option of limiting the number of participants to an event and event ratings.</p>

                <p>I had fun working on such an open-ended prompt and talking to so many different people about their hobbies and passions. It was uniquely challenging to consider how people approach play differently and brainstorm effective ways to bring these people together. In future iterations, we planned to incorporate an option to sync with Google Calendar, send out invites to specific users, and allow multiple users to host an event. My roles in this project were <span style="color: #1aa361; font-weight: bold;">primary UX researcher and designer.</span></p>
