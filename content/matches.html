                <p class="topic">the challenge</p>
                <br/>
                <p>Our team of 3 was given an open-ended design task: <b>Create a mobile app to help with play.</b> Faced with such an ambiguous challenge, we broke the prompt down further—we asked ourselves, what is play? What activities are considered play and what activities aren't? What does it mean to help with play? Are we making play possible or easier, and in what way?</p>
                <br/>
                <p class="topic">user interviews</p>
                <br/>
                <p>In order to address this prompt, we had to understand what play meant to different people. We set out into the student union, where students could be found studying, gaming, and relaxing. We walked up to people and asked them: <b>“What does play mean to you?”</b> We framed this question loosely to see what associations people came up with. Following their response, we asked them how they organized "playtime" and if they had any barriers that prevented them from playing.</p>
                <br/>
                <div>
                    <img class="feature" src="../assets/matches/interview1.JPG" />
                    <figcaption class="caption">Exploratory user interviews</figcaption>
                </div>
                <br/>
                <p>Unsurprisingly, we received an array of wildly different responses. Play was described as video games, basketball, and even breakdancing. Some people said they preferred doing solo activities, such as drawing, whereas others preferred group activities like multiplayer gaming and contact sports. We noted that some of the biggest hindrances to play, as reported by our interviewees, was <b>finding/making time for play and organizing group activities.</b></p>
                <br/>
                <p class="topic">brainstorm</p>
                <br/>
                <p>Based on our user research, we designed multiple target statements we wanted to address with our app. We asked ourselves the following: </p>
                <br/>
                                    <div>
                    <img class="feature" src="../assets/matches/goals.png" />
                </div> 
<br/>
                <p class="topic">our idea</p>
                <br/>
                <p>Our idea was Matches, a Tinder-inspired social platform where users can <b>discover activities nearby and organize events with new people who share the same interests.</b> Users can post and promote activities and swipe on events they're interested in. Activities can range from video games to sports to dancing—anything that involves socialization. 
</p><br/>
                <p>Not only does Matches bring people together to play, but it encourages discovering new hobbies and interests. With this mobile app, users can compete and collaborate with each other in a variety of activities, creating a local community of facilitated gameplay.</p>
                <br/>
                <p class="topic">iteration and prototype</p>
                <br/>
                <p>The following is a user flow diagram, which outlines how we envision users will interact with our app. We designed our app around a central feed, which also directs to discover mode, a user's "matched" activities, profile, and messages. </p>
                <br/>
                <div>
                    <img class="feature" src="../assets/matches/mapping.png" />
                </div>
                <br/>
                <p>Then, we wireframed most of the fundamental screens of our app. We included features like messaging so that users can discuss details of meetups and get to know each other.</p>
                <br/>
                                <div>
                <img class="feature" src="../assets/matches/wireframe1.png" />
            </div>
                <br/>
                                                <div>
                <img class="feature" src="../assets/matches/wireframe2.png" />
                <figcaption class="caption">Wireframes</figcaption>
            </div>
                <br/>
                <p class="topic">field testing</p>
                <br/>
                <p>To improve upon our wireframes, we needed to conduct some usability testing. We gave participants our paper prototype screens, and observed their interactions with the app. Our goal was to <b>gauge user reactions and identify usability issues</b> early in the process.</p>
                <br/>
                <div>
                <img class="feature" src="../assets/matches/interview2.JPG" />
                <figcaption class="caption">Field testing with prototype</figcaption>
            </div>
                <br/>
                <p>From the feedback we received, we found that most people liked the concept and said they would use it. The Tinder analogy was useful, but we realized we should not rely on it too heavily, as not everyone is familiar with the Tinder "swipe". Based on the suggestions we received, we added explicit “interested”/”not interested” buttons instead of expecting the user to just swipe left or right. We also added event caps and the option to rate events.</p>
                <br/>
                                <p class="topic">final design</p>
                <br/>
                <p>blah blah</p>
                <br/>
                                <p class="topic">reflection</p>
                <br/>
                <p>I had fun working on such an open-ended prompt and talking to so many different people about their hobbies and passions. It was uniquely challenging to consider how people approach play differently and brainstorm effective ways to bring these people together. In future iterations, we planned to incorporate an option to sync with Google Calendar, send out invites to specific users, and allow multiple users to host an event. My role in this project was <b>primary UX researcher and designer.</b></p>
