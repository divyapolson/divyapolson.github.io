                <p>This was my first hackathon as well as my first time working with hardware! My contributions were connectivity, programming the gesture logic, and implementing push notifications. Although it was difficult to get our application to connect with the device initially, the process was a great learning experience and intro to wearable tech overall. We only had 24 hours to implement it, but given more time we could have refined our mobile app and prototyped a more stylish, subtle bracelet to better suit everyday use. </p>

                <p class="topic">user research and insights</p>
                <br/>
                    <p>To further understand customer needs, we interviewed young people about their general checkout experience in retail stores. We asked questions such as the following:</p><br/>
<ul><li>How often do you shop at large retail chain stores? </li>
<li>Tell us about an irritating checkout experience at a retail store.</li>
<li>What is your ideal checkout experience?</li>
<li>How important (on a scale from 1-10) is speed when you check out?</li>
<li>Do you usually use self check-out at other stores? Why/why not?</li>
<li>Is there anything you would improve about self check-out?</li>
</ul><br/>
                    <p>People said that their ideal checkout experience was speedy, involved talking to staff as little as possible, and getting help from sales associates when needed. When rating the importance of speed in the checkout process the interviewees reported an average score of 9 (on a scale from 1-10). Overall, responses to self-checkout and our idea were positive.
    </p>

                <p class="topic">our solution</p>
                <br/>
                <p>Shopify combines the traditional brick-and-mortar shopping experience with the customer behavior and independence of e-commerce. </p>
                                    <br/>
                <p>Customers are mainly young adults that are frequent app users, who don’t see personal contact in the store as a value-adding feature of the in-store experience. </p>

                <p class="topic">ideating and iterating</p>
                <br/>
                <p>In our ideation process, we mapped out user interactions on a whiteboard and designed a cognitive workflow analysis. Based on this work, we came up with a low-fidelity paper prototype.</p>
                <br/>
                    
            <div>
                <img class="feature" src="../assets/shopify/wireframe" />
                <figcaption class="caption">Cognitive workflow analysis</figcaption><br/>

                <figcaption class="caption">Field testing with low-fidelity prototype</figcaption>
            </div><br/>
                    <p>We wanted to observe how real users would react to and interpret our screens in their low-fidelity form. We gave each of the users the scenario that they were in a Forever 21 store and had just found a nice T-shirt. Their task was to purchase it with this new app. In order to complete the task, they had to create new account and get acquainted with the app. We watched closely how they interacted with the screens and what buttons they pushed, feeding them with the corresponding new screens. We took note of where they hesitated and asked questions about how they experienced Shopify, and where they saw room for improvements. They all had very different input and steps that they liked and disliked, concerning everything from confusing symbol representation to extra selections they wanted to have, especially during account setup. From our testing, we realized that some important frames were missing (such as “Purchase Complete”) and we added tutorial frames to quickly get the user up to speed on how to use the app.</p>
