                  <p>Shutdown is a <span style="color: #e02c2c; font-weight: bold;">4 player cooperative-competitive board game about the U.S. government and politics.</span> Each player has the special abilities of one of the 4 entities of government: the Executive branch, Judicial branch, Senate, and the House of Representatives. By playing through a series of bills, elections, and other events, players try to gain points based on their role and advance their political party’s agenda.  </p>

                  <br/>
                  <p>Shutdown is primarily targeted toward U.S. middle schoolers and high schoolers currently learning about the government in the classroom. Applicants for U.S. citizenship are also a potential target demographic.</p>

                  <p> Our principal learning goal is to <span style="color: #e02c2c; font-weight: bold;">teach players about the role of each branch in government and how they function as a cohesive unit.</span> Through gameplay, players should learn:</p>
                  <p><ul>
                    <li>law-making procedures</li>
                    <li>the delicate system of checks and balances</li>
                    <li>political strategy</li>
                    <li>how parties/agendas can create conflict within the decision-making process</li>
                  </ul></p>
                  <p>On a higher level, Shutdown also teaches communication, conflict resolution, and resource management.</p>

                  <br/>
                  <p>We expanded on our initial ideas by drafting the sequence of game events on a whiteboard. At this point, we outlined general concepts such expected gameplay and the various elements of a round. Then, we narrowed our focus to specific game materials, by creating a shared document where we each contributed content for all the cards. Once we finished creating content, we went through a few iterations of card designs before deciding on a simple, minimalistic art concept. To bring our game to life, we visited the Fab Lab to print our cards and scoreboard on cardstock. For the purposes of our prototype, we borrowed tokens and a die from other board games. </p>

                  <p class="topic">Playtesting</p>
                  <br/>
                  <p>We recruited four college students to playtest our game. We provided them with an overview of the game concept, the rules, and setup instructions. From there, we observed them as they played through several rounds of the game and offered guidance when necessary.</p>
                  <p>As the playtesting game progressed, we observed several successes and areas of improvement based on the players’ behavior and reactions. Some game mechanics, such as the process for voting on a bill, were somewhat confusing initially. However, after the first two rounds, the players started to play more comfortably and began strategizing with each other to bring down the opposing party. Our goal was to teach players about the different roles of government and cooperative strategies, and our players seemed to respond well to these objectives—they used their knowledge of American politics to make decisions and interact cooperatively and competitively with each other. At the end of the session, players reported that they thought the cards were similar to real world events and that the game could get kids interested in politics. Overall, we received generally positive responses from our playtesters. </p>

                  <p class="topic">Reflection</p>
                  <br/>
                  <p>During the playtest, our volunteers seemed to really enjoy the game, and they were able to recognize the many similarities between the game and the U.S. government. The two parties conflicted with each other and strategized amongst themselves just as they do in the real world. They recognized that they were reacting to in-game events that paralleled actual events. They also discovered that things get chaotic when players are constantly attacking one another and shutting down the government. The meaning that comes from this game is all in the experience, which differs between each game. Players will also learn different things based on their own past experiences. Somebody who is just starting to learn about the government will get a deeper understanding of how the different roles interact with each other and the amount of power in each. Somebody who is well-versed in American politics can learn something by exploring what it would be like if, for example, the Judicial branch were to attempt to reject every bill that passes. They would see the importance in having a judiciary that is fair, since a biased judge could easily take advantage of the system. There is something to be gained for everyone.</p>
