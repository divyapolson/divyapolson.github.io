          <p class="subtitle">
            I refreshed the Target App post order experience, adding new
            capabilities for users to better track and manage their orders.
          </p>
          <p>
            While at Target, I spent a 6 month rotation as a Product Designer on
            the <b>Core iOS Team</b> within Target App UX. The Core iOS Team
            focuses on pattern and accessibility enhancements for a consistent
            experience across the Target App. My goal was not only to elevate
            the app to be on par with the robust features on Target.com, but
            also to envision fresh mobile interactions and solutions.
          </p>
          <p>
            Along with my work on post order, I designed improvements to product
            pages, animated app illustrations, and reimagined the onboarding
            experience.

              Target had been receiving a high volume of calls to Target Guest
              Services (TGS), their Customer Service call centers.
            </h2>
            <p>
              Users had been calling frequently and wanted to know:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Where’s my stuff?</li>
              <li>When will it get here?</li>

          <p class="subtitle">
            Each call to TGS costs Target about $15, and the current rate of
            contacts per order was costing Target millions of dollars.

            <p>
              It was critical to increase transparency and clarity around the
              post order experience to reduce any points of confusion or
              uncertainty about orders.

            <p>
              With new capabilities that were not previously possible on the

            Synthesizing UX Research

          <p>
            During the first couple weeks, I began to frame and define the
            problem, going through UserTesting.com insights and synthesizing the
            UX research that had been compiled.

            Competitive Analysis
          </p>
          <p>
            I also assessed competitors such as Amazon, Walmart, and other
            online retailers to understand they approached their post order
            experience and what we could learn from that.

          <p class="subtitle" style="margin-bottom: -5px;">
            State Mapping
          </p>
          <p>
            Next, I met with different teams across Target to delineate the
            journey of an order. These meetings helped me map out over 40 order
            status states over six different fulfillment methods. Examples of
            fulfillment methods include shipping to home, store or drive up
            pickup, and delivery through email.

            Due to NDA restrictions, I am unable to share most artifacts from my
            process. Here are some flow iterations I did in Sketch.

          </p>
          <p>
            I created mockups in Sketch and received feedback from the UX team
            during design crits. Throughout this process, I worked closely with
            a designer on the Android app and kept in close contact with the
            Product Manager on my team to ensure we were aligned.

            Intercept testing
          </p>
          <p>
            Midway through my iterations, I created an Invision prototype and
            approached guests in a Target store to test my designs with them and
            get reactions in-person. Using the feedback, I made a few more
            tweaks.

          <p>
            Nearing the end of the project, I created final specs and
            documentation using Zeplin and collaborated with the engineers as
            they gradually began to implement designs over the next couple
            months.

            </h2>
            <p>
              Based on the state mappings across all fulfillment methods, I
              created these animated circular order status indicators. These
              leveraged color and spacing to quickly show the current progress
              of an order. I crafted the animation to give more visual texture
              to the statuses and reflect the full order journey.
            </p>
            <p>
              One of the most common call reasons was to ask, "Where's my
              stuff?". To ease stress about users' orders, I used color to
              indicate order status so they could see it at a glance and be
              reassured that their order was on track. A burnt orange color
              indicated any delays or actions that required attention.
            </p>

              I moved the order number up to the top of the page for easy
              reference and to increase visibility. The tracking progress bar
              here is a linear representation of the circular indicators seen
              above, marking the current state in the order journey. Similar to
              the Order History page, color was used to indicate status.

            <p>
              According to call metrics, users often called to get an invoice,
              return an item, or fix an issue, without realizing they could do
              all of this within the app. These actions were buried in the order
              details and had low awareness. To address this, I made these
              actions more salient and added new icons for smooth scanability. I
              also used grey to reduce emphasis and indicate that an order
              didn’t require attention once it had been completed or delivered.

          <h2 style="padding: 0;">Store pickup</h2>
          <p>
            For this fulfillment method, I incorporated a bottom sheet as a way
            to notify users that their order was ready. The pickup barcode was
            made more prominent so that users could quickly pull it up, reducing
            friction at the store.

              Enable order notifications
            </h2>
            <p>
              Based on user metrics and engagement data, our team noticed that
              many users hadn’t enabled notifications for the Target App. This
              likely caused some of the uncertainty people had about when they
              could expect their order to arrive. I created this popup that
              would prompt users to enable tracking notifications so that they
              can stay up to date on their order journey. This popup was timed
              carefully for right after a user placed an order on the app.

            <p>
              For store pickup orders, it's possible that users cannot pickup
              their order personally and want to authorize someone else as a
              pickup person. This sheet allows them to easily enter details for
              an alternate pickup person.

              When it comes to shipping orders, users might realize they sent
              the package to the wrong address or want to change the delivery
              location. I designed these sheets that slid out from the bottom as
              a quick and unobtrusive way to give users the control to complete
              these tasks.

          <p>
            Originally when users had a question or needed help, we directly
            provided them with the contact information and phone number for
            Guest Services. Clearly, this played a part in why Target was
            receiving so many calls. As an alternative, I created a page for
            common Help Topics that could be easily accessed at the top of the
            order details screens. I worked closely with Guest Services for the
            content of the Help Topics and prioritization.

          <h2 style="padding: 0;">Concierge</h2>
          <p>
            Concierge is Target's help service for returns and replacements. It
            was built out on Target.com, but had yet to be implemented on the
            mobile app. Because of this, customers often called TGS in order to
            begin the return or replacement process for their items. To make it
            possible in the app, I simplified the Concierge service into three
            steps, illustrated below:
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              <b>What happened?</b> Gather information on which items need
              addressing and the issue.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>How can we help?</b> Offer options for replacement and/or
              refund depending on order.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Let's review.</b> Summarize the Concierge report and any next
              steps.

              Store purchases
            </h2>
            <p>
              One of the larger goals for the Target App, especially one that
              separates from the website, is to be a bridge between stores and
              digital. I explored ways to incorporate a user’s in-store
              purchases into the app.
            </p>
            <p>
              This works by matching the card on file with the card used at the
              register to track and display store purchases. This would be a new
              way for users to re-purchase items they had bought previously in
              stores, create shopping lists, and generally better connect both
              experiences.

          <p>
            Going deeper into in store purchases, I designed this Trip Summary
            page that gives an overview of the store purchase including the
            items that were bought and store details. At the top, any discounts
            or any sales applied to the order are highlighted, so that users
            feel good about the money they saved. I collaborated with a UX
            writer so that the messaging around this was peppy and friendly,
            consistent with Target’s branding.

            Designing for 50 million+ users
          </h2>
          <p>
            This was my first time designing for such a large audience, which
            certainly felt intimidating at times. Unlike other projects I had
            worked on, I struggled with feeling disconnected from my users.
            However, I quickly learned to use research and metrics to draw a
            comprehensive picture of user needs, and conduct interviews and
            testing with users to provide clear snapshots of their experience. I
            also gave a lot more consideration to accessibility, working with
            Target's Accessibility Analysts to make sure the new features could
            be used by everyone.
          </p>
          <h2 style="padding-top: 20px;">
            Cross-disciplinary alignment is key
          </h2>
          <p>
            Working on a cross-functional product team taught me how to relate
            to and balance the needs of other team members. For instance, when
            collaborating with my product manager, I would emphasize user needs
            and the business case for a certain approach. Whereas when handing
            off designs to engineers, I tried to make their lives easier by
            making sure to document constraints and edge cases clearly. I also
            found it useful to leverage fellow designers for critique and
            mentorship, even if they worked on different parts of the business
            and did not have all the context I did.
          </p>

          <h2 style="padding-top: 20px;">
            When in doubt, divide and conquer
          </h2>
          <p>
            I was presented this huge challenge, with so many fulfillment
            methods and possible order journeys, that could easily be
            overwhelming. As you saw, the post order experience contains a lot
            of moving pieces. In order to tease out the complexities, I
            discovered it was helpful to break the problem down into small,
            digestible parts, map all possible states, and tackle them
            individually before zooming out again.
