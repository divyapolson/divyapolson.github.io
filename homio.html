          I collaboratively researched, prototyped, and designed the end-to-end
          product experience for an interactive water bottle intended to aid
          individuals experiencing a panic attack.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our graduate student team of three was tasked with creating a design
          response in the mental health space. We realized there weren't many
          tools or platforms dedicated to panic attacks, and we decided to
          address this gap. From there, we spent 10 weeks defining our problem
          space, ideating, prototyping and testing our product.

          Our response
        </p>
        <p>
          We designed <b>Homio</b>, a customizable water bottle with tactile,
          interactive attachments to help individuals ground themselves in
          reality and regain a sense of control during a panic attack. Homio
          also dispenses aromatherapeutic scents associated with relaxation and
          stress relief. We paired our bottle with a website that allows users
          to try sample swatches, customize and build their own bottle, and
          order add-ons.

            Our research indicated that adolescent and young adult age is when

            Major life changes during these years (for example, transitioning
            from high school to college) often result in stressful environments.

          <p>
            Panic attacks happen without warning at anywhere,
            anytime—experiencing one in a public setting adds anxiety to this
            already mentally and physically debilitating event.
          </p>
          <p>
            We narrowed in on classrooms because among our target users, this is
            where they spend much of their day and it is often a source of
            stress.

            other long-term recovery methods. Rather, our goal is to support
            individuals in the highly focused moment of a panic attack, when
            they feel least in control.

            Our research indicated that grounding exercises are a powerful

            distract the user with various sense-engaging visuals, scents, and
            textures embedded into each side. We envision this to be
            inconspicuous and portable, perhaps attached to a keychain for easy
            access. It would ideally divert user's thoughts toward a more
            relaxed state, so they can recover from the panic attack discreetly.

            To learn what sensory materials users would like to engage with, we
            created different samples for people to touch, smell, and see. We
            asked participants to tell us what they liked and disliked and if
            they felt comforted by the materials in the context of anxious
            situations.

          <p>
            We prototyped a low-fidelity cardboard cube connected to a keychain
            to test the interaction. We asked participants to simulate using it
            by holding the cube and interacting it with their eye, nose, and
            ear. We wanted to test whether this object would be easy to access
            during a panic attack and if the user felt comfortable using it in
            public.

              We had to rethink our form factor to make it more practical and
              accessible. To explore objects that already exist in the everyday
              life of a student, we held a small co-design session with
              participants to learn what they carried on a daily basis. Looking
              around, we saw one item that almost everyone had on the table was
              a personal water bottle. We went forward with a water bottle as it
              promotes hydration, is easily accessible, and integrates
              seamlessly with the classroom setting.

            This was a challenging, yet rewarding experience that taught me a

            Mental health carries a lot of stigma, trauma, and characteristics
            that vary from person to person. We kept this in mind throughout our
            process, from problem definition to the final design response. I
            discovered that co-design is a particularly powerful method to
            connect with your audience's needs and keep them involved throughout
            the design process. In participant research, it was important to
            craft questions and activities thoughtfully to ensure they weren't
            potentially triggering or uncomfortable. In our design, we wanted to
            counter traditional cold, detached mental health tools by making
            ours feel warm, approachable, and accepting.

          <p>
            This was one of the first times I designed for a physical product,
            which meant there were a lot of opportunities for personal learning
            throughout this process. Everywhere we looked, there were
            constraints with regards to material, durability, and costs. I
            learned that rapid prototyping with recycled materials is a great
            way to test out ideas quickly and inexpensively. Additionally, with
            three different touch points of our product (the physical bottle,
            the website, and the packaging), it was a challenge to make the
            overall user experience feel seamless throughout. However,
            thoughtful branding and a unified design language helped in creating
            a more connected experience.
