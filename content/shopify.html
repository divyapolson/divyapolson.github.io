                <p>This was my first hackathon as well as my first time working with hardware! My contributions were connectivity, programming the gesture logic, and implementing push notifications. Although it was difficult to get our application to connect with the device initially, the process was a great learning experience and intro to wearable tech overall. We only had 24 hours to implement it, but given more time we could have refined our mobile app and prototyped a more stylish, subtle bracelet to better suit everyday use. </p>

                <br/>
                <p>Customers are mainly young adults that are frequent app users, who don’t see personal contact in the store as a value-adding feature of the in-store experience. </p>
                <br/>
                <p class="topic">user interviews</p>
                <br/>
                <p>
<ul><li>How often do you shop at large trendy retail chain stores? </li>
<li>Tell us about something that annoys you about retail chain stores.</li>
<li>What do you like about them?</li>
<li>Tell us about an irritating checkout experience at a retail store.</li>
<li>What is your ideal checkout experience?</li>
<li>How important (on a scale from 1-10) is speed when you check out?</li>
<li>Do you usually use self check-out at other stores? Why/why not?</li>
<li>Is there anything you would improve about self check-out?</li>
</ul>
                    <p> The responses were all very similar. Duration of the checkout process and waiting in line
were important factors to the interviewees. Multiple people told stories about going in to buy
something specific for an event and having to put it back because the checkout line was too
long and they didn’t have time to wait. The consensus regarding ideal checkout experience
was a speedy checkout, having to talk to as little people as possible (mainly the retail staff),
help from sales associates when needed, and a generally positive checkout atmosphere.
When rating the importance of speed in the checkout process (on a scale from 1-10) the
interviewees reported an average score of 9. All interviewees stated they would, in fact, use
our product, especially if they are purchasing only a few items. They appreciated being able

to see everything, individual prices and total cost, right in front of them so there is no need to
guess. Feedback on our app idea included: suggestions for a way to contact sales associates
in case you need help, a magnet instead of tags, and pointing out that a potential problem
could be getting the customers to trust the app. Overall, the responses were positive.
