                <br/>
                <p>Tradeback is a web-based trading platform where users can <b>exchange items and services</b>. Websites like eBay and Craiglist offer a similar consumer-driven marketplace, but they emphasize purely monetary-based transactions. With Tradeback, instead of offering money for a job, you could offer a service in return. For example, if I need calculus tutoring but don’t have money to spend, I could create a post offering chemistry tutoring in exchange for the work. Tasks and items are represented by trading “cards”, and users can see their transaction history and gain a reputation. This encourages users to <b>give back to others by sharing their skills and expertise</b>, and fosters a sense of community and cooperation between members. </p>

                <br/>
                <p>Our primary target audience is college students or young adults. Tradeback is a good option for those who are tight on money or have skills they’d like to offer. It can be especially beneficial to people doing freelance work as a living.</p>

                <br/>
                <p>We started out with simple wireframes for core website components such as browsing and viewing post details, trading cards, and user profiles.</p>

            <section>
                <p>Based on informal user feedback, we made some adjustments to our prototype, including adding a transaction history on user profiles and a "comment" area for users to add additional details on trade offers. The following screens are our medium-fidelity prototypes.</p>

                <br/>
                <p>We used React to create a responsive frontend for our platform, and Node and Express on the backend. The data for our users and posts was stored in a MongoDB database. We implemented trading functionality, user authentication, messaging, and smart searching/filtering.</p>

                <p class="topic">reflection</p>
                <br/>
                <p>My contributions were <b>front-end development and lead UX design</b>. Aside from implementing the front-end in React, I also had the opportunity to interact with data in our MongoDB database. If we had more time, we would have developed an in-application chat so users could discuss specifics of their trade or negotiate further (instead of linking to Facebook Messenger). We also would implement a rating system so that users can review other users’ services and rate their transaction. With a few more iterations, it would be useful to do some further usability testing and identify areas of improvement. Overall, I learned a lot about web development and community markets, and I could see Tradeback being successful among college-age adults.</p>
