        </br>
    <p>I grew up in the sunny San Francisco Bay Area where I was surrounded by bubble tea and constant digital innovation. Now I am in my final year at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, graduating this May with a B.S. in Cognitive Psychology and a minor in Computer Science. </br></br>My passion lies in the intersection of technology and design: I leverage my research skills to dissect a problem, inform a user experience and design, . This past summer, I was a UX Engineer intern at John Deere. Ask me about my experience!</br></br> Aside from work, I love ramen, street photography, and exploring new places. If youâ€™re interesting in collaborating or just want to learn more, feel free to get in touch! </p>
