                <p>This was my first hackathon as well as my first time working with hardware! My contributions were connectivity, programming the gesture logic, and implementing push notifications. Although it was difficult to get our application to connect with the device initially, the process was a great learning experience and intro to wearable tech overall. We only had 24 hours to implement it, but given more time we could have refined our mobile app and prototyped a more stylish, subtle bracelet to better suit everyday use. </p>
