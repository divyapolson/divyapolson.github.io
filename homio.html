        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>
          We created homio, a sensory water bottle that is uniquely designed for
          individuals experiencing a
          <span class="word"
            >panic attack<span class="definition"
              >episode of intense fear that triggers severe psychological and

          or extreme anxiety. The inspiration for the name comes from the Greek
          word
          <i>homeostasis</i>, and supporting the body's return to stable
          conditions.
        </p>
        <p>
          Homio leverages aromatherapy by dispensing scents associated with
          relaxation and stress relief. It also comes with tactile, interactive
          attachments that help individuals ground themselves in reality and
          regain a sense of control. Through our website, users can try out
          sample swatches, customize and build their own bottle, and order
          additional add-ons.

        <p class="heading">Ages 15-25</p>
        <p>
          Adolescent and young adult age (15-25) is when panic attacks typically
          onset and peak.
        </p>
        <p class="heading">The classroom</p>
        <p>
          Many struggle with handling this mentally and physically debilitating
          experience in public settings such as classrooms. We are focusing on
          classrooms because among our target users, this is where they spend
          much of their day and it is where stress tends to come from.

        <p class="heading">Real time, in the moment</p>
        <p>
          Our response is in no way meant to be a replacement for therapy and
          long-term recovery methods. Rather, we want to support individuals in
          the highly focused moment of a panic attack, when they feel least in
          control.

        <h2>Deep dive into research</h2>
        <p class="heading">Cultural probes</p>
        <p>
          Secondary research gave us a general, medical understanding of panic
          attacks. However, as panic attacks are such uniquely individual
          occurrences, we knew it was important to capture information on
          behaviors and attitudes surrounding panic attacks and get a closer
          glimpse into people's experiences. Two cultural probes were
          distributed to six participants with a history of panic attacks.
        </p>
        <p class="subheading">Probe #1</p>
        <p>
          Our first probe aimed to address the following research questions:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>How are people affected physically during a panic attack?</li>
          <li>How do they perceive those symptoms?</li>
        </ul>

          First probe and participants' responses. The probe featured an outline
          of the human body and instructions that read "Indicate where you feel
          affected by a panic attack, and how. Feel free to shade, draw, and/or
          write short descriptions."

          <li>
            Do they feel comfortable with people in their circle and understood
            by them with regard to their panic attacks?

          Sample participant response from the second probe. We instructed
          participants to sort people in their network based on their level of
          awareness and support. Participants placed circular cards with various
          members listed on them (e.g. "therapist", "partner", etc.) along with
          any blank cards anywhere along this spectrum.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="section">
        <p>
          In general, we found that people like teachers, supervisors, and
          school counselors fell to the "no awareness, no support" side of the
          spectrum. Partners, parents, and therapists tended to be the strongest
          supporters. Friends, siblings, and peers landed somewhere in the
          middle.
        </p>
        <p>
          With the supportive group, we have the opportunity to provide tools so
          they can better support people with panic attacks. For the unaware
          group, we can help educate them in order to bring them into the
          supportive circle.

        We made the big assumption that those experiencing panic attacks would
        want to bring the people who are in the position of “no support,
        awareness, or understanding” to the other side of the spectrum. We still
        needed to understand:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Who do they feel comfortable getting support from?</li>
        <li>
          What kind of support do people want?

            Through a stakeholder mapping activity, we identified the primary,
            secondary, and tertiary actors that are impacted by panic attacks.
            From this, we outlined connections between stakeholders as potential
            design opportunities and categorized pain points, desired outcomes,
            and negative outcomes.

          blankets and stress balls. Rather than hiding in a school public

        <p>
          Our sensory cube concept was aimed at facilitating grounding
          exercises. Therapists have recommended grounding exercises as a
          strategy to bring people’s attention back to the present by connecting
          them with the physical world around them. It encourages the users to
          focus on something they can touch, hear, smell, taste, or see. We
          believe a solution that leverages this can help divert people’s
          thoughts toward a more relaxed state, so they can recover from the
          symptoms of panic attack discreetly.

          To learn what sensory materials users would like to engage with, we
          created different samples, which people could touch, smell, see. We
          asked participants to tell us what they liked and disliked and if they
          felt comfortable or uncomfortable about the materials in the context
          of anxious situations.

          We found strong positive responses to smell and interactive textures
          from our participants. Many were familiar with scent and the benefits
          of lavender. Others enjoyed soft, smooth textures that relaxed them.
        </p>
        <p>
          The size of the cube keychain was slightly too big, and participants
          felt it could be difficult to access. People felt somewhat comfortable
          interacting it with in public, but any close-up interactions (such as
          smelling it or holding it up to the eye) felt awkward.

          Since the general response to the keychain was that it was awkward and
          could be perceived as childish, we had to rethink our form factor. We
          wanted to explore objects that already exist in the everyday life of a
          student. We held a mini co-design session where we asked participants
          what they carried with them on a daily basis. Looking around, we saw
          one thing that pretty much everyone had on the table was a personal
          water bottle. We decided to go forward with a water bottle concept as
          it promotes hydration, is easily accessible, and integrates seamlessly
          with the classroom setting.

          The homio bottle is designed to be discreet, minimal, and
          sophisticated. The texture attachments sit at the base of the bottle
          where the user can easily access them. To make the attachments as
          inconspicuous as possible, they match the color of the bottle by
          default. The cap contains a small, twist-to-open compartment where
          scent concentrates can be applied when they run out. The bottle was 3D
          modeled using Maya and comes in 5 different colors, the default

          Everyone has their own unique reactions to different textures and
          scents—what's helpful and relaxing to one person may not be to
          another. To account for these differences, we designed a sample box
          for users to try out attachments before choosing their final
          customization. We developed the following scent and texture assortment
          based on our prototyping insights and secondary research. Our scents
          not only range in their benefits, but also cater to people’s
          preferences—varying from sweet to more herbal and earthy tones. The
          textures we provide also range from being passive and soothing to more
          interactive.

          This was a challenging, yet rewarding experience that taught me a lot
          about designing for a product with multimodal touchpoints and working
          closely with sensitive populations.

          The importance of sensitive design

          Mental health comes with a lot of stigma, trauma, and characteristics
          that vary from person to person. We kept this in mind throughout our
          process, from problem definition to the final design response. I
          discovered that co-design is a particularly powerful method to connect
          with your audience's needs. In participant research, it was important
          to craft questions and activities carefully and get feedback on them
          to ensure they weren't potentially triggering or uncomfortable. In our
          design, we wanted to counter traditional cold, detached mental health
          tools by making ours feel warm, approachable, and accepting.

          This was one of the first times I designed for a physical product,
          which meant there were a lot of opportunities for personal learning
          throughout this process. Everywhere we looked, there were constraints
          with regards to material, durability, and costs. I learned that rapid
          prototyping with recycled materials is a great way to test out ideas
          quickly and inexpensively. Additionally, with three different touch
          points of our product (the physical bottle, the website, and the
          packaging), it was a challenge to make the overall user experience
          feel seamless throughout. However, thoughtful branding and a unified
          design language helped in creating a more connected experience.
