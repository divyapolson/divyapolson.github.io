                <br/>
                <p>Personal safety is a deeply relevant issue for me and my teammates, particularly as young women. Based on our personal experiences, we knew that walking alone at night can be daunting and potentially dangerous, especially when in an unfamiliar area. In the event of an attack, in the case that your standard self-defense mechanisms fail, it is difficult or impossible to reach for your phone and get help. For this 24-hour hackathon, we wanted to tackle this issue and create a product that <b>protected and empowered women alone at night or in any unsafe environment.</b></p>

                <p class="topic">Our solution</p>
                <br/>
                <p>We came up with Superwoman, a <b>wearable device accessible at all times, that notifies personalized contacts or authorities in the event of an emergency</b>. We decided to use the Myo gesture control armband to help us in our mission. With the Myo's gesture recognition technology, all a user has to do is squeeze their fist three times in a row once they recognize that they're in danger. Paired with our iOS application, this gesture triggers push notifications (containing location data) to the authorities and the user's personal emergency contacts. If the gesture is triggered by accident, the user can cancel the alerts just as easily.</p>

                <br/>
                <p>This was my first hackathon as well as my first time working with hardware! My contributions were <b>connectivity, programming the gesture logic, and implementing push notifications</b>. Although it was difficult to get our application to connect with the device initially, the process was a great learning experience and intro to wearable tech overall. We only had 24 hours to implement it, but given more time we could have refined our mobile app and prototyped a more stylish, subtle bracelet to better suit everyday use. </p>
                <br/>
                <p><b>publicity: </b>A new-media organization, Driven Media, chose to document our team's progress throughout the hackathon. They published an awesome hour-by-hour breakdown of our brainstorming, research, and development process. <a href="http://drivenmedia.org/team-superwoman/" target="_blank"><b>Check it out!</b></a> </p>
